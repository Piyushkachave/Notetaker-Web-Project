# Notetaker-Web-Project
Developed a web-based Note Management application that allows users to create, view, update, and delete notes. Used  Servlets and JSP for handling requests and displaying pages, and Hibernate to connect with the MySQL database. Followed  the MVC pattern to keep the project well structured and easy to maintain.
